Analytics on Uber Data

Project Overview
Welcome to our GitHub repository for the "Data Analytics on Uber Data" project! The primary goal of this project is to perform data analytics on Uber trip records using a variety of cutting-edge tools and technologies provided by the Google Cloud Platform (GCP). By leveraging GCP's robust ecosystem and Python programming language, we have created a dynamic dashboard that offers real-time insights and analysis of Uber trip data.

Technologies Used
1. Python: We utilized Python as the primary programming language for data processing, analysis, and visualization tasks. Python's versatility and robust libraries make it a top choice for data analytics projects.

2. Google Cloud Platform (GCP): GCP offers a suite of cloud services that have been instrumental in our project's success. The following GCP components were crucial to our data analytics workflow:

   - Google Storage: GCP Storage stores and manages the raw and processed Uber trip data securely. This ensures data integrity and easy access for further analysis.

   - Compute Instance: We leveraged GCP's Compute Instance to run our data analytics processes efficiently. This allows us to scale resources as needed to handle large datasets and complex computations.

   - BigQuery: Google BigQuery serves as our data warehouse and analytics platform. It enables blazing-fast SQL queries on massive datasets, providing us with quick and valuable insights.

   - Looker Studio: Looker Studio serves as our data visualization tool, allowing us to build interactive and informative dashboards to present the analysis results in an easy-to-understand manner.

Dataset Used:
For this project, we used the "TLC Trip Record Data" for both yellow and green taxis. The dataset includes essential fields such as pick-up and drop-off dates/times, locations, trip distances, fares, rate types, payment types, and passenger counts reported by the drivers. This rich dataset allowed us to perform in-depth analytics and gain valuable insights into Uber's operations and patterns.

Dashboard:
As a result of our efforts, we have developed an intuitive and real-time dashboard that showcases the findings from our data analytics. The dashboard offers a user-friendly interface to interact with the data and explore various metrics and visualizations. It enables stakeholders to make informed decisions and gain valuable insights into Uber's trip data.


Thank you for visiting our GitHub repository! Let's unlock the potential of Uber's data together through data analytics and visualization. Happy analyzing!
